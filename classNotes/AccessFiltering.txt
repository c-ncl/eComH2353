# Access Filtering

The goal of access filtering is to prevent requests from users that do not fit criteria to reach resources that require these criteria.

e.g., you need to be logged in to reach your profile


## DRY principle

DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself". This is a programming principle whereby you write code once and use it many times. This is done to increase scalability and maintainability of code.


## Metadata: Attributes

<html><head><title>This is a title</title></head><body>
<p>This is <em>text</em></p>
</body></html>

Classes have
- properties
- methods
- metadata: information about the class, their properties, methods, constants, parameters

The metadata can be:
- comments
- DocComments: These are documentation comments that allow the documentation of code /** This is a DocComment */
- Attributes (as of PHP 8): structured, machine-readable metadata information.

If a class was a fir (un sapin),
Metadata would be decorations,
And together we would have a christmas tree.

Metadata does not affect how code runs. However, metada can be read and used in an algorithm.


## Reflection Objects

Toward the purpose of reading metadata, in PHP we use the ReflectionObject class.

It allows us to access and use metadata, and more importantly attributes. 


## ...back to Access Filtering

Using Attributes, we will define metadata criteria on Controller classes and their methods. These criteria will have to be met in order to allow traffic to reach controller methods.

As part of the routing algorithm, we will verify the set attributes for each controller method called and choose to allow or refuse access to these resources.
